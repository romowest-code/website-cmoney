### TOOL 1.1: Contractor Hourly Rate Calculator

**Target Search:** "how much should I charge as a handyman", "contractor hourly rate calculator"

**URL:** /tools/hourly-rate-calculator

- Comparison: "If you charge $X/hour, you'd make $Y/year"

**UI Components:**
- Slider inputs for quick adjustment

## API CONFIGURATION

```javascript
// /lib/openai.js
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
})

export async function generateWithAI(prompt, options = {}) {
  const {
    model = 'gpt-4o-mini',
    temperature = 0.7,
    maxTokens = 1000
  } = options

  try {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      temperature,
      max_tokens: maxTokens
    })
    return { success: true, content: response.choices[0].message.content }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('OpenAI Error:', error)
    return { success: false, error: error.message }
  }
}

// Rate limiting (server-side)
const rateLimiter = new Map()
const RATE_LIMIT = 10 // requests per hour per IP

## NOTES FOR CLAUDE CODE

1. Build each tool as a standalone component that can be independently deployed and tested
2. All calculation logic should be in separate pure functions for easy unit testing
3. Use React Query or SWR for AI tool API calls with caching
4. Implement proper loading and error states for all AI tools
5. Mobile-first: design for 375px width first, then scale up
6. Every tool needs its own SEO metadata - don't use generic descriptions
7. CTA should be contextual to the tool, not generic "Try C-Money"
8. Rate limit AI tools on both client (localStorage) and server (IP-based)
9. Cache AI responses where appropriate (business names can be cached longer)
10. Implement proper error boundaries so one broken tool doesn't crash the site
